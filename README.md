## Writing an interpreter in Go

I have not done much in Go, mainly focused on Python and JavaSript (dabbled in C, C#, Java and Rust), so using this as an excuse to learn some Go.


This is my implementation of the Monkey interpreter as I'm going though the book **Writing an interpreter in Go** by Thorsten Ball.
